## Niles - the Digital ManServant
This repo is the backend, the read me file is on the frontend: https://github.com/DiegoOTdC/Niles-Frontend

Since Niles - the Digital ManServant is all about making my life a bit easier, I also decided to use [Codaisseur's template](<https://github.com/Codaisseur/express-template>) to make setting up the backend a little easier.
